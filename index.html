<h3 class="github">Today we talking about github</h3> 

<p class="git1"> GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on 
    software development 
 projects. It provides a hosting service for Git repositories, which are primarily used to store 
code for projects in a distributed manner. Here are some key aspects of GitHub:
</p>
<ol type="I">

<li> <span>Version Control:</span> GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system,
     to track changes 
    to files in projects over time. This allows developers to collaborate on code without 
    overwriting each other's work.
</li>

<li>Repository Hosting: GitHub provides a place to store Git repositories in the cloud. Each
     project typically has its own repository where developers can store code, documentation,
     and related files.</li>
<li>Collaboration: GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers
     by offering features such as pull requests, which allow contributors to 
     propose changes to a repository, and issues, which are used for tracking tasks, 
    bugs, or discussions related to the project.</li>


<li>Social Networking: GitHub is also a social platform for developers.
     Users can follow each other, star repositories they find 
    interesting, and contribute to open source projects.</li>

    <li>Integration: It integrates with various other tools and services, such as continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) systems, project management tools, and more, making it a central hub for software development workflows.

    </li>

<li>Open Source: GitHub hosts millions of open source projects, which are freely available 
    for anyone to use,
     modify, and contribute to.</li>

</ol>

<p class="git1">Overall, GitHub has become a crucial tool in modern software development, 
    fostering collaboration, transparency, 
    and community-driven innovation.</p>
